            Numbers are the fundamental units of mathematics. In this article,
            we will discuss numbers, their types, important facts, divisibility
            rules, and other essential concepts for aptitude preparation.

            <h2>Types of Numbers</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Integers:</strong> All numbers whose fractional part is
                0 (e.g., -3, -2, 0, 1, 10, 100).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Natural Numbers:</strong> Counting numbers such as 1, 2,
                3, 4, 5, 6…
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Whole Numbers:</strong> All natural numbers and 0.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Prime Numbers:</strong> Numbers having only two distinct
                factors, 1 and the number itself (e.g., 2, 3, 53, 67, 191).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Composite Numbers:</strong> Numbers greater than 1 that
                are not prime (e.g., 4, 60, 91, 100).
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Important Points on Prime Numbers</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>0 and 1 are neither prime nor composite.</li>
              <li>2 is the only even prime number.</li>
              <li>
                There are 25 prime numbers less than 100: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13,
                17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79,
                83, 89, 97.
              </li>
              <li>
                Two numbers ‘a’ and ‘b’ are <strong>co-prime</strong> if their
                HCF = 1.
              </li>
              <li>
                The number of divisors of <em>n</em> (if its prime factorization
                is p₁ᵉ¹ × p₂ᵉ² × ... × pₖᵉᵏ) is (e₁ + 1) × (e₂ + 1) × ... × (eₖ
                + 1). <br />Example: 200 = 2³ × 5² → Number of divisors = (3 +
                1) × (2 + 1) = 12.

            <p>
              The cyclicity of a number is based on its unit digit. Each digit

            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Digits 0, 1, 5, 6 → same unit digit for any power.</li>
              <li>Digits 4, 9 → cyclicity of 2.</li>
              <li>Digits 2, 3, 7, 8 → cyclicity of 4.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>4² = 16 → unit digit 6</li>
              <li>9³ = 729 → unit digit 9</li>

        <h2>Logical Reasoning Questions and Answers</h2>
        <p class="updated">Last Updated : 23 Jul, 2025</p>
        <p>
          Logical Reasoning involves the ability to use and understand logical
          connections between facts or ideas. In verbal reasoning, questions are
          expressed in words or statements and require critical thinking to
          choose the correct answer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Non-verbal reasoning, meanwhile, involves questions presented as
          images or figures, requiring comprehension of relationships between
          visual elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          Logical Reasoning tests your problem-solving, analytical, and critical
          thinking skills, making it a key component in many exams and job
          assessments.
        </p>

        <h3>Logical Reasoning Topics</h3>
        <ul class="topics-list">
          <li>Number Series</li>
          <section>
            <p>
              A <strong>Number Series</strong> is an ordered sequence of numbers
              arranged according to a specific mathematical rule or pattern.
              Each number in the series relates to the others through consistent
              operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division,
              exponents, or other logical relationships.
            </p>

            <p>
              Number Series is a widely asked topic in the
              <strong>Logical Reasoning</strong> section of competitive
              examinations. There are two main types of questions:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Missing Term Series:</strong> A sequence is given with
                one or more missing numbers. You must find the correct number
                that fits the pattern.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Wrong Term Series:</strong> A complete sequence is
                given, but one number is incorrect, and you must identify or
                correct it.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Arithmetic Series:</strong> Each term increases or
                decreases by a fixed difference.<br />Example: 5, 9, 13, 17, ...
                (+4)
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Geometric Series:</strong> Each term is multiplied or
                divided by a fixed ratio.<br />Example: 3, 6, 12, 24, ... (×2)
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Square Series:</strong> Terms are squares of natural
                numbers.<br />Example: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ...
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Cube Series:</strong> Terms are cubes of natural
                numbers.<br />Example: 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, ...
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Fibonacci Series:</strong> Each term is the sum of the
                two preceding terms.<br />Example: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Prime Number Series:</strong> Series of prime

                <strong>Alternating Series:</strong> Combines two or more
                different operations alternately.<br />Example: 1, 4, 3, 6, 5,
                8, ...
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Factorial Series:</strong> Based on factorials.<br />Example:
                1, 2, 6, 24, 120, ...
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Mixed Series:</strong> Combines multiple patterns.<br />Example:
                2, 5, 10, 17, 26, ...
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Exponential/Power Series:</strong> Involves powers or
                exponents.<br />Example: 2, 4, 16, 256, ...

            <ul>
              <li>Observe the difference between consecutive terms first.</li>
              <li>If the difference is constant → Arithmetic Series.</li>
              <li>If the ratio is constant → Geometric Series.</li>
              <li>
                If differences are increasing/decreasing → check for squares or
                cubes.
              </li>
              <li>
                Try multiplying or dividing terms if no pattern is visible.
              </li>
              <li>
                Write each term as a product of two factors to find hidden
                patterns.
