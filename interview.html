    <!-- Types of Interviews -->
    <section id="types">
      <h2>Types of Interviews</h2>

      <h3>1. Structured Interviews</h3>
      <p>Each candidate is asked the same set of questions in the same order. This ensures fairness and easier comparison between candidates.</p>

      <h3>2. Unstructured Interviews</h3>
      <p>The interviewer follows a conversational approach, adapting questions based on your responses to gauge personality and spontaneity.</p>

      <h3>3. One-on-One Interviews</h3>
      <p>A direct interaction between you and the interviewer, focusing on your resume, skills, and fit for the position.</p>

      <h3>4. Panel Interviews</h3>
      <p>Conducted by multiple interviewers who evaluate different aspects such as technical, behavioral, and cultural fit.</p>

      <h3>5. Group Interviews</h3>
      <p>Several candidates are interviewed simultaneously. This tests leadership, teamwork, and communication skills.</p>

      <h3>6. Stress Interviews</h3>
      <p>Used to assess how you perform under pressure. Interviewers may act impatient or ask tricky questions deliberately.</p>

      <h3>7. Informational Interviews</h3>
      <p>Not a formal job interview but an opportunity to gather insights about a company or industry from professionals.</p>

      <h3>8. Competency-Based Interviews</h3>
      <p>Focus on specific skills or behaviors essential for the job. Questions often begin with “Tell me about a time when…”</p>

      <h3>9. Assessment Center Interviews</h3>
      <p>Includes group discussions, presentations, psychometric tests, and case studies to evaluate your overall potential.</p>

      <h3>10. Telephonic Interviews</h3>
      <p>Initial screening conducted over phone or video to assess communication and suitability before an in-person round.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Interview Questions -->
    <section id="questions">
      <h2>Types of Interview Questions</h2>

      <h3>1. Behavioral Questions</h3>
      <p>These focus on your past behavior in work situations. Example: <em>“Describe a time when you resolved a conflict.”</em></p>

      <h3>2. Traditional Questions</h3>
      <p>These are standard, direct questions like: <em>“Tell me about yourself”</em> or <em>“Why do you want to work here?”</em></p>

      <h3>3. Case Questions</h3>
      <p>Common in consulting and management interviews, where you analyze a hypothetical business scenario and propose a solution.</p>

      <h3>4. Role-Play Questions</h3>
      <p>You’re placed in a simulated situation to observe your problem-solving and communication approach.</p>

      <h3>5. Industry-Specific Questions</h3>
      <p>Technical or job-related questions relevant to your field, such as coding, marketing, or finance.</p>

      <h3>6. Brainteasers</h3>
      <p>Creative problem-solving questions like <em>“How many golf balls can fit in a bus?”</em> to assess logical thinking.</p>
